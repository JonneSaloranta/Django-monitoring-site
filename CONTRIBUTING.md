# Contributing Guidelines

- Avoid adding new non-standard libraries if at all possible. If you have an idea that would require one, please suggest it as an issue first instead of going through all the work and submitting a pull request.

- MAKE SURE IT RUNS

## Version Naming Convention â‡¨ Release Version = x.y.z

x = Major Version: Major Overhaul / Restructure of Project
y = Minor Version: New Features / Functionality
z = Patch Version: Bug Fixes After Release
